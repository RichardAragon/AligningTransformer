# AligningTransformer
A Hybrid Layer Architecture That Fuses Transformer and RNN Architecture

## Introduction

`AligningTransformer` is a state-of-the-art neural network architecture designed for advanced sequence-to-sequence tasks. Leveraging the power of both recurrent neural networks and transformer models, `AligningTransformer` excels in understanding and generating sequential data. Its unique hybrid structure combines the robustness of traditional RNNs with the scalability and parallelization benefits of transformers, making it ideal for a wide range of applications such as machine translation, text summarization, and speech recognition.

## Features

- **Hybrid Encoding**: Utilizes a custom-designed `HybridEncoder` that combines RNN cells and self-attention mechanisms for effective sequence encoding.
- **Decoder Alignment**: Incorporates a `DecoderWithAlignment` module, aligning encoded sequences with the target for improved accuracy.
- **Positional Encoding**: Employs positional encoding to maintain sequence order, enhancing the model's understanding of temporal dynamics.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Features advanced techniques like batch normalization, dropout, and adaptive learning rate schedules to optimize training.
- **Gradient Clipping**: Implements gradient clipping to prevent the exploding gradients problem, ensuring stable training.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable for various sequence lengths and target tasks.

## Installation

To install `AligningTransformer`, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RichardAragon/AligningTransformer.git
cd AligningTransformer
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Here's a quick example to get you started with `AligningTransformer`:

```python
from aligning_transformer import Model
from torch.optim import Adam
from scheduler import CustomScheduler

# Initialize model
device = "cuda"  # or "cpu"
model = Model(device=device, max_target_length=100)

# Setup optimizer and scheduler
optimizer = Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
scheduler = CustomScheduler(optimizer)

# Train the model
train_model(model, num_epochs=10, data_loader=train_loader, optimizer=optimizer, scheduler=scheduler, val_loader=val_loader, criterion=my_criterion)

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'aligning_transformer_model.pth')
```
